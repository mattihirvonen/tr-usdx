# tr-usdx
Alternative application firmware variant for my (tr)uSDX device.
I have interest to test different band sets as default firmware have.
  - lo bands: 80m - 60m - 40m - 30m - 20m
  - probably change 80m and definitely 60m band(s)s to 17m or/and 15m band(s)

I do not have any useful antenna for low bands and 60m is not enough traffic to interest.
